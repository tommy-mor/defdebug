# defdebug

A Clojure debugging utility that gives two macros: defnDEBUG and letDEBUG.

The idea is that if you are having trouble with a function ``(defn foo [x y] (* x y))``, you can swith it to be ``(defnTEST foo ...)`` which expands into ``(defn foo [x y] (def x x) (def y y) (* x y))``.

This means you can inspect the body of the function with your repl with all the values filled in. This is meant to be paired with a git commit hook which prevents any defnTEST's from getting into production.
